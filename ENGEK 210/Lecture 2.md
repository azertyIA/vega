In order to rank your objectives do pairwise comparison in a big ass table. Then add up the wins of everything in order to get a score. Then you have a proper ranking. 

### Conceptual Design
The artist usually makes anything and then the engineers get their hands on it and wreck it, for reality of course. It's one big loop before making the first engineering prototype. ChatGPT replaces the artist, as per usual. BUT DON'T HAVE IT WRITE YOUR REPORTS.

Going back to the glass box, everything inside of it is just a function. Then you select parts to perform those functions. For instance, to get non-contact temperature, you use the Blackbody Radiation effect and pick up an IR sensor. Any camera sensor sees all spectrums. You can make an easy prototype in under $50. Another option you have is an infrared camera (or a bunch of sensors). 

### Morphology Chart
The last step of the process is putting all your means (answers to a function) in a big chart. This is JUST TO COLLECT and brainstorm the possible ways to achieve a function.
