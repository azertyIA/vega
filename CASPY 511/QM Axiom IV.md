#PY511 
The fourth of five [[QM Axioms]].
## Consequences
The only possible result of measuring something is one of the eigen values corresponding to an operator.

After obtaining some eigenvalue, the system is forever found in the corresponding eigenstate, thereby "collapsing the wavefunction." Apparently young physicists don't really like this interpretations, because this violates Axiom 2. This is inconsistent.

Others believe that after the measurement, the wave functions of the system and observer become entangled. Thus, the system continues to evolve according to the Schrodinger equation.
