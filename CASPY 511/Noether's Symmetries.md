From [[Lagrangian Mechanics]], a symmetry is a transformation on the coordinates $y(t)$ (which will now be named $q(t)$) that leaves the action invariant:
$$S=\int dtL(q,\dot q)=\int dtL(q',\dot q')=\int dtL(q,\dot q)+\delta L$$
For instance if space were translated such that $q\mapsto q+\delta q$:
$$\int dtL(q+\delta q,\dot q)$$
