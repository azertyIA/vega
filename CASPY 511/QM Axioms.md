## Axioms
There are five-ish of them:
1. [[QM Axiom I]]: The pure physical state of a particle is completely described by an element called a ray (vector) in a complex Hilbert space V with a norm derived from an inner product.
2. [[QM Axiom II]]: The system is governed by a Hamiltonian that is described as the partial time derivative of the wave function multiplied by a coefficient.
3. [[QM Axiom III]]: The physical system of a composite system featuring two different Hilbert spaces $\ket{A}\in V,\ket{B}\in W$ can be completely described by a ray in the tensor product space $V\otimes W$.
4. [[QM Axiom IV]]: A physical observable is represented by a Hermitian Operator $\hat A$ on the elements such that a measurement on a system will return just one of its eigenvalues.
5. QM Axiom V: The measurement process violates Axiom 2 or causes entanglement.
