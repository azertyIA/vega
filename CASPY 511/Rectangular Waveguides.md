So why do rectangular waveguides barred from using TEM waves.

The BU radio station oscillates at 90 MHz. In the AC system you create a displacement current. So, everything is relevant. For the loop antenna case, you just rotate the two ends together.

Sometimes people put things into arrays. For example people like putting the antennas in a orthogonal or "turnstile" configuration.

Along a single piece of antenna, you create an electric dipole moment.
$$\vec p=\vec dQ$$
For a loop antenna, you create a magnetic dipole moment.

Iron in particular has randomly oriented spins, but when you apply a magnetic field you get
