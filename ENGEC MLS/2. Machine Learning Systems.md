### Single Deployment Paradigms
Machine learning systems have to be flexible to many different environments.
- **cloud computing** offers heavy throughput but high latency.
- **edge computing** prioritizes latency for immediate responses (gpus).
- **mobile devices** offer proximity but must meet power requirements
- **embedded systems** have much lower latency at the cost of complexity

Obviously you can combine more than one for a more complete integration to get **hybrid ML**. For example, training could occur on the cloud where it only has to occur once to actually acquire the model and inference can be done on a lower latency compute. 

Hierarchical processing involves balancing central processing power with local responsiveness. In industrial IoT applications, tiny sensor can perform anomaly detection and work its way up to cloud level analytics. Progressive deployment adapts super big cloud models into models usable by edge or tiny devices. Federated learning enables learning from distributed data while maintaining privacy. Collaborative learning complements hierarchical by having devices of the same tier communicate with other data.
