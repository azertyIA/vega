The **dot product** describes how similar two vectors are to each other. Usually you're supposed to use normalized vectors to get a better understanding, but you don't need all that.

In cartesian coordinates different unit cartesian vectors have zero similarities to any other (orthogonality), so as a result, only similar components multiply:
$$\sum A_iB_j(\hat v_i\cdot\hat v_j)=\sum A_iB_j\delta_{ij}=\sum A_iB_i$$
