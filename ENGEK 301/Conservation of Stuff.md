If we have a box that have boundaries and we put stuff in the box, like a quarter, then the time derivative of stuff in the box should be rate at what we put stuff into the box subtracted by the rate at what we take out.
$$\partial_t[stuff]=enter-leave+conversion$$
To count bunnies in a field, you need to draw a boundary. Bunnies can cross this boundary, can be born or can die. So all of those need to be accounted for in the rate of change of bunnies. In a similar fashion, force is a source of momentum:
$$\vec F=\partial_t\vec p$$
In many cases, $\vec F$ is the sum of all forces crossing the boundary.
