Quiz on Monday!

Electrons hold negative charge, existing in the conduction band when a semiconductor is n-doped. If a semiconductor is p-doped, positively charged holes are missing electrons from the valence band.

If a voltage is applied across a block of silicon, the electrons and holes feel a force:
> $F=-eE$ (electrons)
> $F=+eE$ (holes)

When these particles move a current density is created:
> $\vec{J}=\rho\vec{v}=\rho\mu E$ (current / area); $\mu$ is mobility (cm / V-s); $\rho$ is charge density

Drift current is the current in the presence of the E-field:
> $J=J_n+J_p$

Carriers want to diffuse from high concentrations to low concentrations. For some reason. Definitely apart from the whole E&M deal. The "minimal energy configuration" of a gas is a uniform gas.
> $J_p=-eD\nabla p$, $p$ is the number of holes
> $J_n=eD\nabla n$, $n$ is the number of electrons

Diffusion and drift will both govern the carriers in devices. Meaning, if you put an n-type semiconductor and a p-type semiconductor two things might happen instantly:
1. The electrons move to the p-region and the holes move to the n-region due to diffusion.
2. A depletion region is created featuring no carriers.

In other words, *diffusion causes the depletion region*.
> $eV_0=k_BT\ln\frac{np}{n_i^2}$

When voltage is positive, the E-field barrier to diffusion get lessened due to the drift current. As a result, the barrier is weakened allowing current to flow. Otherwise, the electric field widens and gets stronger, preventing current. There is theoretically no voltage drop.
> $I=I_s(e^{eV/kT}-1)$

Non-ideal diodes have an extra factor:
> $I=I_s(e^{eV/nkT}-1)$

The rectifier can be used to turn an altering sinusoidal signal to only "return" a positive signal. It consists of a resistor and a diode.

There are few different diode models:
> $I_D=\frac{V_{DD}-V}{R}=I_s(e^{eV/nkT})$

Wherever these formulas overlap is where $V$ is the correct solution. These help to really simplify the circuit.

$V_{zk}$ is described as the breakdown voltage for a Zener diode. You can use it in place of $V_0$, which can be used to do different calculation if you are given a test voltage and current.
