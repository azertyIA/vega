Problem 1: I would have done it the same way on the test. 

Problem 2: I would have done part one the same way on the test. 

Determine the Poynting vector at the boundary of the conductor and verify the Poynting theorem.
> $E=\vec J_c/\sigma=\vec I/2\pi a^2\sigma$
> $H=I/2\pi a=\sigma ES/2\pi a$

Poynting vector:
> $\vec P=\hat zE\times I/2\pi r_0\hat\phi=-\hat r E(\sigma ES)/2\pi r_0$

Poynting theorem:
> $\vec s=\hat r(2\pi aL)$
> $\oint_Sd\vec s\cdot\vec P=(-\hat r\cdot\hat r)\sigma E^2(\pi a^2)L$
> $=-\sigma E^2(\pi a^2)L=I^2L/\sigma A$
> $R=\frac L{\sigma A}=\frac L{\sigma(\pi a^2)}$
> $\oint d\vec s\cdot\vec P=-RI^2=-V^2/R$ (checks out)

Problem 3: I would have done part one the same way on the test. 

If I did not specify that part 2 had to have equal amplitudes, then I would have specified such.

For part 3, I would have specified that the thumb has to be the propagation direction as the circular wave evolves in time, but I think I did that.

For part 4, I would have noted that the E field could either be perpendicular (s-polarization) or contained in the plane of incidence (p-polarization) and as a result, the p-polarized component is *reflected* less strongly than the s-component but *transmitted* more strongly than the s-component. 

The two different physics at play can be combined to make the Fresnel equations which govern the transmission and reflection coefficients of an oblique wave.

Problem 4: I would have done it the same way on the test.
