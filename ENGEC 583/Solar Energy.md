### Small-Scale Harvesting
You might see around residential areas and parking lots that have some amount of solar panels. This is small scale harvesting that works for some families in only some states.
### Large-Scale Harvesting
This features more energy contributing to a global energy supply. It used to be impossible to send satellites out into orbit. Shit blew up. But now, we have loads and loads of orbiting satellites to power themselves with the sun.

We have since moved from that. Now we're better booming our development in microelectronics and AI applications. The Genesis mission aims to put a huge emphasis on science. But they took NIH funding away? Anyways, space-based solar power allows satellites to reap energy without the obstructions from weather. 
### Sow Before You Reap
People have pushed to make their own solar energy through nuclear fusion to combine hydrogen atoms into helium and releasing crazy amounts of solar radiation. 

There are two devices that try to fuse shit.
1. **Laser Fusion**: the LLNL had enough energy put in that went out to break even (WR). 
2. **Magnetic Fusion**: has been conducted for decades, but now we got continuous energy for minutes compared to milliseconds. This is the one we're gonna talk about a lot more

Start with Helmholtz coils, which orient a magnetic field vertically. To make an artificial sun, you need high **temperature and pressure**.
$$D+T\to H_e+n+14.8\text{ MeV}$$
D and T represent heavier isotopes of helium. It's not completely clean: there's still neutrons flying around at crazy speeds. Argon is used to keep an inert atmosphere which has a fun purple color. Regardless, there's some complicated magnetic fields to hold charged particles in place (like a cyclotron), but you can also keep its velocity in one part (aligned with the magnetic field). Neutrons cannot be easily contained.

Let's get a different, aneutronic process going then:
$$_1^2D+{}_3^6Li\to2_2^+He+22.4\text{ MeV}$$
$$p^++{}_3^7Li\to2_4^+He+17.2\text{ MeV}$$
$$p^++{}_3^6Li\to{}_2^3He+2_4^+He+4.0\text{ MeV}$$
$$p^++{}_5^{11}B\to3_2^4He+8.7\text{ MeV}$$
Lithium is crazy rare though. But we have enough...
