There are two cases here. on the right side let's go through the possibilities:
1. $V_I=HI$: both transistors are on, both diodes are off, so it only goes through the transistors
2. $V_I=LO$: both transistors are off, both diodes are on, so the source gets to dump to ground

As a result, the current is preserved and no energy goes to blow up or dissipate in a bad spot.
