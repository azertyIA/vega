A geometric distribution finds how many consecutive Bernoulli misses are made before the first Bernoulli hit. As such, the geometric distribution has the single parameter $p$.
$$P_X(x)=\Sigma p(1-p)^n$$
## Expectation Value
$$\mathbb E[X]=\Sigma np(1-p)^n$$
$$=p\Sigma n(1-p)^n$$
$$=p/p^2$$
$$\mathbb E[X]=1/p$$
## Variance
$$\mathbb E[X^2]=\Sigma n^2p(1-p)^n$$
$$=p\Sigma n^2(1-p)^n$$
$$=p/p^2$$
$$\mathbb E[X]=1/p$$
