In general one way to get a probability is to count the number of ways to get a certain sample divided by the number of ways to get anything.

In general, replacement leads to the following pattern (take 52 cards for example):
> $13/52\times12/51\times\dots$

If this kept going, until all were selected, you'd get a product that looks like:
> $(52-13)!(13!/52!)$
