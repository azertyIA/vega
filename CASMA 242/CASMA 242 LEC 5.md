## Introduction to Linear Transformations

If we wanted to define a linear function from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ , then we would need a matrix with $n$ columns and $m$ rows. 
> A *transformation* (or function or mapping) $T$ is a rule that assigns one vector space to another vector space.
> Given a matrix $A$ with transformation $T$, the *image* of a vector $v$ under transformation $T$ is $Ax$.

A vector is in the range of the transformation if the image under a transformation can be that vector.

Some properties arise:
> $A(\vec{u}+\vec{v})=A\vec{u}+A\vec{v}$
> $A(c\vec{v})=cA\vec{v}$

All else is fair game?

The transformation from a domain to the codomain is constrained by the range. You can build a matrix from what it does to the basis vectors.
