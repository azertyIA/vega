Wafer-scale chips provide die to die bandwidth but have limited area for on-chip memory. As a result, parallelism strategies should maximize communication and efficiency on memory to actualize WSCs.

(requires ring configuration) The tensor stream partition paradigm alleviates stringent on-chip memory constraints but generates three challenges:
1. severe tail latency
2. prohibitive D2D traffic contention (parallelism conflicts)
3. intractable search time for optimal design (TATP extends parallelization space)

TEMP is a framework that attempts to overcome hardware and parallelism constraints. 1.7 average throughput.
